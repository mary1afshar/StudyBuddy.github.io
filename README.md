# About Us
As two online Computer Science students at the University of Waterloo, we were inspired to create StudyBuddy because we noticed that online school has caused many students to be isolated from peers, friends and teachers. StudyBuddy's mission is to provide a personalized virtual assistant, liv to help students stay motivated with custom reminders and messages.
